# Simple Shell Project

This repository is a group project for ALX, which contains code for a shell-like program designed for UNIX operating systems.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to create a simple shell-like program as part of a team project for learning.

## Files

The repository contains the following files, each named according to its function:

- **builtins.c**: Contains functions for built-in commands such as `ls` and `exit`.
- **main.c**: Houses the main program responsible for creating the shell prompt.
- **main.h**: Includes function prototypes and necessary libraries.
- **environment.c**: Holds the environment function responsible for printing environment variables.
- **error_msg.c**: Contains the error message function that is triggered when a command fails to execute.
- **concat.c, compare.c, strlength.c**: These files contain functions for string manipulation, including concatenating strings, comparing strings, and checking string lengths.
- **path_check.c**: Used to verify the path of a command or user input to determine if it's a built-in function.
- **tokenization.c**: Contains functions for tokenizing strings and creating child processes when a non-built-in command is entered. Child processes execute these commands.
